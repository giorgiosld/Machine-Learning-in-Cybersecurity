# Spam Detection

This directory contains resources and code developed as part of the "Machine Learning in Cybersecurity" course at 
Reykjav√≠k University during the Fall Semester 2024. The topic of spam detection is explored through the implementation
of a spam email classifier using Python and scikit-learn. This classifier is trained to identify spam emails based on 
their textual content, illustrating key concepts discussed in the course, such as data preprocessing, feature 
extraction, and model evaluation.

## Directory Structure
- [Assignment](assignment/): Contains the assignment details.
- [Datasets](dataset/): Contains the email datasets used for training and testing the classifier.
- [Lab](lab/): Contains the Python scripts used for data processing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

For more details on other topics covered in this course, refer to the main repository's [README](../README.md).


## Dataset
+ The dataset used to train the model is the [Lingspam Public Dataset](dataset/train-mails).
+ The dataset used to evaluate the model is the [Lingspam Public Dataset](dataset/test-mails).
